## Why it was developed?

Production management software was developed for Lavello s.c. Company. Their old system to manage orders and all production processes was very slow and length between production and shipment to client was 14 days! Marking product with order number was done by writting on it with marker... Which make so many confusions due to different handwritting.

Processes which needed optimalisation:
- Getting orders to first step of production
- Follow status of exact orders
- Marking product with proper order number, model and many more

## What it did for the company?

First introduction into company was done on 01/06/2021. Workers were trained from UI and steps of their own forms. 
Every workplace got their own form. There are 5 steps which are needed for products to be ready for shipment. We've made UI very simple not to make workers confused and allow them to easily get their work done. We wanted to make things faster - not harder!

## From start to finish
#### Shorter production time
Implementation of this software allowed company to speed up whole process and shorten the length from 14 days to... just 5! It was impressing and satisfying result.

#### Easier communication
Before implementation, company's customer service was calling(!) workers to get information about statuses of orders. This resulted in many, many unecessary calls, walks to proper workplace and ask for this product. It was nightmare! 
Now customer service has it's own panel. (More on that below)

## Customer service
Customer service got their own panel also. It allows them to:
- check status of the order, 
- upload clients technical drawings
- watch packing recordings to verify if everything was packed
- chat with workers
- and many more...
